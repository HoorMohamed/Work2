# Task1

How to run the program:
-------------------------- 
1. You should put the script in your location in the system.

2. Make the script executable with the below command:

          $chmod +x Scriptname
    
3. For macOS & Linux: 

   - The systems have Python version 2.* by default, so you can run the script with the below command:
  
          $python Scriptname      # This is if you're in the same directory of the script or you can replace the "Scriptname" with "Full path"
      
   - If you use Python 3.* version, you can run the script with the below command:
  
          $python3 Scriptname      # This is if you're in the same directory of the script or you can replace the "Scriptname" with "Full path"
